# SteepingTea2

This is the same thing as the app SteepingTea, but it's made in Rails 5.
Heroku's stack hosting the previous version was marked as end of life.
So I took the opportunity to rebuild it using Rails 5 (the previous one was in Rails 4)

I am following a tutorial on Upcase/thoughtbot, by Matthew Mongeau.
